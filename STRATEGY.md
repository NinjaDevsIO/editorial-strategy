# Strategy

There's no hard limit for the length of the articles but we should strive to maintain them between 800-1500 words.
That way the article is relatively short and enjoyable but also features good content. 

## Posts

One big article per week, with at least 2 HTs (these should match the article's categories)
Pinned in TW and FB profiles. Additionally we can publish a second post EOW.

### Topics

- Tooling
- In depth articles about Advanced/experimental features/frameworks
- Hot New stuff
- DevOps
- Tutorials (step by step or screencast, with code examples and a github repository)

### Publish
Sunday night or Monday morning. An additional article can be posted on Friday.

Re share on Wednesday and Friday (this one will boost the reads on Friday and during the weekend).
If we choose to publish a new post on Friday then this re share won't happen to move the focus into the newly published article.
